Project Description:
For our high school project, our team undertook the task of developing a Command-Based User Interface(CUI) Library Management System (LMS) to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of our school's library. The main objective was to create a user-friendly digital platform that would facilitate seamless information retrieval, resource management, and a better overall library experience for students and staff alike.
So, as to confirm that only an authenticated user is using the project. The user can search
book based on book id, book name, or by author name. To help the user get the required
books issued. To return the book before the last date without fine, or after the specified
time duration with a late fine.

Key Features and Functionalities:

1. Issue books - It helps the user to get the required books issued to the students who are
eligible. It also helps to keep proper records for the books issued and available
to the library with date of issuance.
2. Add books - The admin can add books to the system by entering the details of the
books and can even update the details.
3. Delete books -  The user can remove old, lost or outdated books from the system and
keep a proper record of deleted books with reason for removal.
4. Student details - The user can simply enable or disable students who violate the rules and
regulations of the library. It helps the user to search and view the required
students details from the system.
5. Book details - The user can search book based on book id, book name, or by author
name.
6. Submit books and fine - To return the book before the last date without fine, or after the specified time duration with a calculated late fine. Its helps to keep record of all.
7. Total penalty and collection - It shows all the details of the books submitted in the system with total fine amount calculated within a range of time.
8.  Logout - It terminates the system and user have to login again to use the system again.

Technology Used In Project:

1. My SQl 5.7.26(Back-end): MySQL is a database management system that is used to maintain relational databases. It is an open-source software backed by Oracle Corporation. As it is an open-source database system, the source code can be modified according to our needs. Here, we have use it to store data related to books, students and many more to DBMS.
2. Python 3.7.6 (Front end): Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's
simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of
program maintenance.
We have used Python for the development of the system using modulus for better efficiency and perform all the operations related to the system.
3. Microsoft Word: It is a word processing program, included with Microsoft Office, and it possesses an absolute dominance in its market.
We have used MS Word mainly for documentation purpose.
4. Interface Python with MySQL: MySQl pyhton/connector is an interface for connecting to a MySQL database server from Python.It implements the pyhton database API and is built on top of the MySQL.
The general workflow of a python program that interacts with a MySQL-based database is as
follow:
• Connect to the MySQL server.
• Create a new database.
• Connect to the newly created or an existing database.
• Execute a SQL query and fetch result.
• Inform the database if any changes are made to a table.
• Close the connection to the MySQL server.
A connection is established between Python file and MySQL server for the retrieval, manipulation and storage of data to DBMS through the instruction of the program.

Rules and Regulations of Library
